# Memphis 2

Memphis is a C# operating system built using the Cosmos toolkit. Originally it was meant to be a simple command-line operating system with simple apps like a text editor, file browser and various others.

Memphis' codebase became hard to maintain and was abandoned months ago. Now it's back, with the goal to become more like ShiftOS - without the gameplay elements. It is a rolling-release operating system and is compiled using the latest Cosmos development kit.
